# Workshop Levels

There are different workshop levels based on your skill level. If you're a **Cherub** (beginner), take the classes designed for you to start your first project and learn new skills. If you're a **Angel** (intermediate), there are workshops to teach you some new tools and new methods to make stuff. Finally, if you're a **Archangel** (pro), we have a few workshops on AI and APIs that you might be interested in using. These workshops are designed to let you create a final project at the end of the day, but, if you're just interested in coming here to learn, we'll have support for that as well!
