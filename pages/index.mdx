## A place for everyone.

Underrepresented students are systematically discouraged from pursuing tech. Schools in LA have little to no computer science education programs—and students aren't exposed to programming until late high school or college. We're hoping to encourage students of all backgrounds, ages, and location to learn and love programming. No matter who you are, you’re welcome here—and you’ll surprise yourself by what you can accomplish. 💛
